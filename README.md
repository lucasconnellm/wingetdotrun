## Why winget.run?

## Features
You can visit our website at [winget.run](https://winget.run). Below are some of our features with more coming soon!

#### Package navigation
- Access all of Microsoft's Windows 10 packages through a modern interface.
- View the most recently added packages at a glance on our homepage - see if theres anything that interests you!
- Search packages by name, organisation, or even keywords. Don't know exactly what you're looking for? - our search has you covered!
- List packages by organisation; now you can install all those Microsoft packages in one go.
- View detailed package info and versions on our detailed package pages.

#### Easy installation
- Copy the install command with one click and paste it into your terminal - it's that easy!
- Bulk install packages with ease; select everything you want and copy a single install script.

#### Modern design
- Modern and professional design
- Responsive; works on both desktop and mobile at varying screen sizes.
- Accessibility; our website works with screen-readers and keyboard-only input.

## API
Our API provides the required functionality for our website and allows us to query live package data. All relevant infomation can be found in our [GitHub repo]().

As we are still early in development, our API has not yet been made public and is subject to breaking changes without notice. If you'd like access, please don't hesitate to [contact us]() and we can work something out!

## Community
We have a [Discord]() server! Come join if you're interested in the project, have some questions for us, or just want to hang out. If you're more of a [Twitter]() person, we also have an account on there.

We'll make our best efforts to post any updates and interact with the community on both platforms so if you're on any one of those then you're set.

## Roadmap
While we think that [winget.run]() is currently in a usable and complete state, we have many features planned going forward in the hopes of further impoving user experience. That being said, our roadmap is currently fairly limited as the project is still in its infancy; it hasn't even been 2 weeks since the [announcement of winget]() as of writing this.

#### Completed
- Basic usable API.
- Basic usable website.
- Automatically importing new packages from Microsoft's [winget repo]().
- CI/CD
- Hosting and deployments

#### Current 
- Getting more users
- Donations/funding to cover running costs
- Code cleanup and refactoring
- Unit and integration testing

#### Future features
- Public API
- Package importer rewrite
- Database migrations
- Observability (devops)
- A/B deployments (devops)
- Canary deployments (devops)

We will work on improving the roadmap down the line as well as solidifying a release schedule. Community requests are, of course, welcome. If you want to report an issue, request a feature, or even have a question, don't be afraid to [open a ticket]()!
